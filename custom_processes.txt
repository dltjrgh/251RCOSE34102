(***************** Custom Processes File *****************)
(* Comments must come here, after the final line
 * This file defines custom processes for a simulation
 * First line should contain a single integer indicating the number of processes
 * Then n lines follow,
 * first integer (i.e. 3 in the second line) indicates its arrival time,
 * second integer indicates the priority (1 ~ 5, 1 being the highest),
 * and the rest are the burst times (oscillating between CPU and I/O, always starting with CPU).
 * The last integer in each line is always 0, indicating the end of the burst times for that process. *)
