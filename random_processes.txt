(***************** Cutom Random Processes File *****************)
(* Comments must come here, after the final line
 * This file defines custom random processes for a simulation
 * First line should contain a single integer indicating the number of process sets (following lines).
 * Then n lines follow,
 * first integer (i.e. 3 in the second line) indicates the numebr of processes in that set,
 * second integer indicates the lower bound of the arrival time,
 * third integer indicates the upper bound of the arrival time,
 * fourth integer indicates the lower bound of the burst time,
 * fifth integer indicates the upper bound of the burst time,
 * The last integer in each line is always 0, indicating the end of the line. *)
